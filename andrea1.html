    I was born in Mexico on June 25, 1999. I moved to NC in 2001 and have been
    living in Durham for the last 17 years. During my free time, I like to play guitar,
    watch youtube, eat, and sleep. My favorite season is Autumn because it's
    not too cold and not too hot but just right. I first got interested in coding
    because I wanted to learn how to make my own websites and apps. Now, it just
    feels pretty cool to help someone out and impact them in a good way with
    something that you created. Some of my personal goals are to make passive
    income with my programming skills and use some of the money travel across the globe.
