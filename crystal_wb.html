        <h1> About Crystal Williams-Brown</h1>
        <div>
            <!--I like double spaces after periods if another sentence follows it-->
           <p>I was born in a small, quaint town on the coast of New Jersey in 1985, to Elnora Williams and Mark Brown. 
            My last name represents both of them.
            My father didn't raise me, however.  My mom did that with my grandparents, aunts, uncles, neighbors and church family.  
            Because of this, I am very diverse in my interests, skills and thinking.</p>  
            
            <p>I come from a musical family, whom also enjoy creating things.  My mom made toys and games for me.  
            My grandma made clothes and taught me how to sew.  My grandpa was a farmer, cook, handyman, you name it.  
            My aunt Carol taught me how to find the right tools for art.  I can go on and on.  Because of them, I could always find 
            a way to thrive in any situation, even hopeless ones.  When all I had was a newspaper, I made paper flowers that 
            people still love to this day.  When I didn't have money for food, I had a garden.  And when I was out of work, very sick and 
            needed something to cheer myself up, I learned how to make cute little video games.</p>
            
            <p>I knew then that programming was meant for me.  The idea of working on a game got me up when I felt absolutely terrible.  
            I was ill for five months and in that time I completed a Coursera course on building games with Unity 3D.  
            I didn't fall behind, I didn't cut corners and I made sure to help my classmates when I could.  
            That showed me that programming is what I should do for a living.</p> 
            
            <p>Life is tough, and I had realized I could be just as miserable with a job as I was without one.
            So I might as well do the thing I want to do when I feel miserable, which is programming.</p>
