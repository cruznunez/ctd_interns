            <p>I was born in Charlotte, NC, to two Venezuelan immigrants. I attended Appalachian State University in Boone, NC. After living there and working in the restaurant industry for years, I decided to move to the Triangle. I wanted to live in an area of diversity, but also a place where I could potentially grow a new career.</p>

            <p>I attended the UNC Coding Bootcamp in the Fall of 2017 and completed the program in February 2018. I am now capable in several different Web Development technologies, namely CSS, Javascript, MySQL, MongoDB, and React.</p>

            <p>Now, I am happy to be working for Code the Dream, an organization that allows me to grow my skills and help others learn. It is an honor and dream come true (pun intended) to work for an organization whose values match my own.</p>
