            I was born and raised in Buenos Aires, Argentina, where I lived for most of my life. I love food, in general -cooking it and eating it-, but particularly empanadas and pasta...paired with a good wine!
            We (my spouse and pets included) moved to the US in 2015 after carefully choosing Durham for its progressiveness and diversity.
            The immigration process has been a challenge, with some ups and downs along the way. It was an obvious inflexion point in my professional life, and I left the HR world behind to focus on finding my own path where I could combine my passion for creativity, design and problem solving, while also hopefully contributing to the social issues that I am committed to.
            I’ve been working as a freelance translator and independent artist, running my own small creative business for the past two years.
            I’m very happy to be part of Ctd, through which I hope to gather the tools and support I need to reach a new milestone on this coding journey.
