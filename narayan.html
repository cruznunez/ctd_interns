      I was only 24 when I first came to the States in June, 2008 from Nepal. There were some obvious challenges that we faced as a new comer. Everything was new and completely different to us as to anybody else who comes from other parts of the world. There was no one that we knew at the time.

      I still remember the long exhausting walk that my brother and I took on a hot summer day not knowing the destination. Actually, we had brought some movie/song CD/DVDs from Nepal, but we had no player. My mother desperately wanted to watch movies or listen some songs since she was so bored. It was because she was staying home all day without any friend or family to talk with. It took about an hour for us before we finally found a Best Buy (on Capital Blvd.) where we bought a DVD player, and it was worth walk.

      I am a proud father of two little girls. The eldest one is almost six and has started going school just recently, the other one is two and half years old. I am an aspiring web developer struggling to make one. When it comes to hobby, I like to watch boxing, soccer, and walk outdoors.
