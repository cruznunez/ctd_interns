           <p>  Hi! Thanks for taking the time to read my Bio, I was born in SanBernardino California. We moved to St. George Ut when I was 12 years old.
                I would have to say that was a dark time in my life I was devastated. 
                Thankfully, after being there for a while I made new friends and we explored a lot aronund the endless amount of dessert that surrounded us. 
            </p> 

            <p> At the age of 22 I decided to join the Army. I wanted to travel and see what was outside of my little town I grew up in. I spent the next 9 years of my life in the military. 
                I visited over 22 States and 3 countries. It was challenging full of good and bad times but after three tours to Iraq I decided I had enough. I got out of the Army Jan 2010 and never looked back. 
                I was really interested in going back to school so I started working on my degeree from 2010 to 2014 I attended Wake Tech and NC State. I finished with a Bachelors in Business Administration and a concentration in Supply Chain Operations. 
            </p>

            <p> After I completed my degree I decided that I could no longer live a life of being someone I wasn't. I am transgender and decided then that I needed to do something about it. 
                I began transition from male to female it was probably one of the hardest things I have ever done. Coming out to my family was stressful most of them are more conventional in their line of thinking. 
                My wife divorced me, job opportunties became fewer and fewer, and dating became complicated to say the least. 
                I didn't let these barriers stop me; I found a job at PiePushers, worked part-time at Code the Dream (now full-time), and worked on the weekends doing yard work for folks.
                During this time of loss and stress I was able to think about what I would like to accomplish what is a passion I have.
                I found that I have a passion for learning and helping others. I think a great way to use those passions is by learing to code here at Code the Dream. 
                I hope to create apps that bring social justice and help others who are need.
