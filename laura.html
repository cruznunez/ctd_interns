        My name is Laura Duran Velazquez.  
        I was born in el Distrito Federal, Mexico. I was brought by my parents to the US when 
        I was just a year old. We arrived to Durham, North Carolina and my family and I have 
        been here ever since. I currently attend Durham Tech and I am now in my second year. 
        I am currenlty getting my associates to hopefully transfer into another university/college.

        Aside from school,
        I enjoy listening, dancing, and singing along to music. I particularly enjoy 90's rock 
        both in engllish and spanish, hip-hop, r&b, pop, cumbia, bachata, zapateado, huapangos,
        banda and merengue. 
        I also like to de-stress myself by going out on 3 miles runs at least three times a week,
        or doing at home cardio workouts. I like to give back to the church that opened many doors
        for my family and I by tutoring others who need it.

        I really began getting to coding in my last year of highschool, when I signed up to take
        a beginners python class. A software developer came to speak to us about what he does and 
        I really thought it was the coolest thing ever. Shortly afterwards I heard of Code the Dream 
        and though it would be a great to take classes. After taking a couples classes I realized that
        coding is somehting I really enjoy and now I am here.
