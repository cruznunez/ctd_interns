        <h1> About Cait Gorevin</h1>
        <div>
            <p>Hi there! My name is Cait Gorevin and I'm an intern through Code the Dream. My primary
            focus is Ruby and Rails but I'm also interested in Python/Django, back-end development,
            and learning how to navigate SQL.</p>

            <p>A bit about me: I'm a military brat but I spent most of my life in Alabama and Wisconsin.
            Of those two states, I claim Wisconsin as home; go Bucky! Long live beer! I moved to North Carolina
            in 2014 to be closer to my parents who retired in Durham. It was quite the transition...going from snow to
            everlasting humidity is difficult to handle but I think I've handled it admirably. Air conditioning helps.</p>

            <p>It took a long time to figure out that programming was the career for me; I was 27 when I decided to go back
            to school for a second degree. I'm currently pursuing an A.S. in Web Development to supplement my B.A. in
            East Asian Languages & Culture. My life is pretty busy right now juggling full-time work with full-time school but
            in my limited leisure time, I love to camp, cook, and code on tiny side projects. I also have an amazing cat.
            That's pretty much all there is to know about me.</p>
